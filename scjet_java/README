Note: Unlike C++ version, we run this algorithm several times
to find out the runtime (which is similar to C++ version for
several events)

How to run the KT jet using Java:

# compile
javac *.java
# or type : make

# Run the code:
java KT ../data/single-event.dat
# or type:  make run


# large sample
java KT ../data/single-event-large.dat
