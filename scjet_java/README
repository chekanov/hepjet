This is an implementation of the SCJet jet algorithm in Java. 
The code supports kT, anti-kT and C/A jet clustering algorithms.

Note: Unlike the C++ version, we run this algorithm several times
to find out the correct runtime (due to JIT compilation).
The runtime after a few iterations should be similar to the C++ implementation.


How to run the SCJet jet using Java:

# compile
javac *.java
# or type : make

# Run the anti-kT jet code:
java SCJet ../data/single-event.dat
# or type:  make run
