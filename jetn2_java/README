This is an implementation of the N*2 jet algorithm in Java by 
Ivan Pogrebnyak <ivanp@msu.edu>. 
The code supports kT, anti-kT and C/A jet clustering algorithms.

Note: Unlike the C++ version, we run this algorithm several times
to find out the correct runtime (due to JIT compilation).
The runtime after a few iterations should be similar to the C++ implementation.


How to run :

# compile
javac *.java
# or type : make

# Run the anti-kT jet code:
java Jet2N ../data/single-event.dat
# or type:  make run
